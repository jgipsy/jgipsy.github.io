Without a good SCM it will be difficult to reach a good port.\nSo we want to show some first steps to work with GIT.</p>\n<p>To start working with GIT, we recommend using an approach to the central repository philosophy (SVN style) against the philosophy of distributed repositories.</p>\n<p>For this it is important to have Gitlab or Github as the central repository.</p>\n<p>Starting from the topology that code repositories are embedded in a central server (either gitlab or github) a simple and intuitive way of working is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Clone the master branch (or development) of the code repository</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code class=\"hljs language-shell\">git <span class=\"hljs-keyword\">clone</span> <span class=\"hljs-title\">&#x3C;URL_REPO</span>>.git</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a branch in local code for the functionality to be developed.
